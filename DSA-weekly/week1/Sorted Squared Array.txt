Sorted Squared Array

  Description
 
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
  in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
  of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

  Sample Input
  
array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]

 Sample Output

[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]

  Function Declaration

const sortedSquaredArray = (array) => {
  return [];
}

  Target Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
